# Wikipedia-Visualization
I created this during graduate school back in 2011. 

Open index.html and punch in a search query in the text box to the right.  The page will lookup this term in Wikipedia, find it's first few links, and begin creating a graph on the page using Three.js.  You can then click on any other node to open it up to it's first few links.  If at any time a node has more than one edge, it will automatically open as well.  This was a study on the state of Three.js back in the day :)
